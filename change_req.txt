Hi Nolan

Finally got around to playing with the app. 
It is very nice piece of work!  A few comments:


1. Query page:
   a. Some attributes (e.g. Name, sku) are Not selectable
   b.  Can you fix the left pane in the query page so we don't have to slide down, to see "Reset" ?
   c. Clicking on YES for the "Citrus" attribute makes the router go away. But, shouldn't clicking on "No" bring it back?
   d. Price does not slide
   e. When attempting to save a transaction, could you display previously set values, if any, in the "Save Transaction page" ?  For example, if  I already saved a transaction with client name ABC and then click save again (without hitting New Transaction), then the Save Transaction dialog box could pre-fill the client name ABC. This will serve to caution the user that they are about to overwrite a previous selection, perhaps, inadvertently.


2. On Device Admin Page:

    a. Can you make the type a selectable list?
    b. Allows creation of duplicate entries

3. Transactions:

   a. After entering the filter, should there be a "Search" button?  {or have to mouse-click on some part of the Filter dialog box]
   b. If not too much effort, could you add all selectable attributes to the Filter under transactions?
   c. Also, add user as a filter so admin can find out the transactions of a specific user


Lastly, please send  me the instructions for hosting it on my website, may be a cheat sheet on how to customize it for my needs.

Sorry about the delay. Have been traveling more then usual lately.

Regards,
